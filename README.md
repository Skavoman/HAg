# HAg
A 999 Byte "game" written in Windows Notepad

About HAg
----

HAg was written for a challenge my friend thbop and I were doing where we needed to use Windows Notepad to write the smallest playable game possible.
For whatever reason, I decided to use VBScript. There is a smaller version of the game that runs via [HPe](https://tucker-slack.itch.io/hpe-re)], which 
is a custom packaged executable system based on Java that I wrote (in notepad). HPe isn't open-source yet, but it will be once I re-write it in Java.

How To Play
----

Align the 'H', 'A' and 'g' to win the game. (This is the type of dumb concept you get from working with VBScript). 
Press the "Yes" and "No" buttons to move left and right and "Cancel" to summon the A.
