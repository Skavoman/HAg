# HAg
A 999 Byte "game" written in Windows Notepad

About HAg
----

HAg was written for a challenge my friend thbop and I were doing where we needed to use Windows Notepad to write the smallest playable game possible.
For whatever reason, I decided to use VBScript. There is a smaller version of the game that runs via [HPe](https://tucker-slack.itch.io/hpe-re)], which 
is a custom packaged executable system based on Java that I wrote (in notepad). HPe isn't open-source yet, but it will be once I re-write it in Java.

Made in Windows Notepad on Windows 10 (Additional edits in mousepad on Raspberry Pi OS)
